# Self-Studying-Theory-of-General-Relativity-
Self- Studying General Relativity Is really tought but following few steps while studying it makes the job much easier. Here, I am going to share with you the steps which I followed and which helped me alot.The mentioned books and self-made notes will found in the given file.

Self-Studying General Relativity:

General Relativity is considered one of the most difficult theories in physics to understand. There is no doubt about its complexity. However, a common myth among physics students is that you cannot self-study general relativity, which I disagree with. Studying General Relativity is not like studying other topics in physics. For example, if you want to study a concept in electrodynamics, you get a good book on the subject, review a bit of the mathematics, build the intuition, and you’re done. General Relativity is difficult at this very point because its mathematics is hard to grasp. Even if you can solve problems, building intuition and a physical connection can still be elusive, leaving you feeling confused about your understanding. It's true that without developing an intuition for the mathematics of General Relativity, you will always feel uncertain about the concepts. Therefore, jumping straight into Einstein's field equations is not an effective way to study GR. I faced this problem when I tried to self-study this subject. However, I found an effective approach that helped me a lot, starting from the very basics. Note that GR is a very broad field, and you cannot master it by just studying these things, but these are the building blocks. Once you understand these basics and familiarize yourself with General Relativity, building upon that knowledge becomes easier.

Study the Mathematics of General Relativity:

1. Basics of Tensors 
Studying tensors in one go doesn’t help much because, while studying tensors, you also encounter different concepts of differential geometry. These become effective when studied in a well-structured manner. Start with the basics of tensors and try to build basic intuition for concepts like types of tensors, rank of tensors, indices, inner products, index contractions, tensor transformations, Kronecker delta, contravariant and covariant tensors, etc. "A Student’s Guide to Vectors and Tensors" by Daniel Fleisch is a good start. I am also sharing a link to a YouTube video series that helped me a lot: [YouTube Tensor Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptMTLzV4-I&list=PLJHszsWbB6hrkmmq57lX8BV-o-YIOFsiG).

2. Differential Geometry 
This subject is crucial for building intuition for General Relativity. After studying the basics of tensors, the next step is to study differential geometry. Focus on concepts like curves, surfaces, curvature, isometries, and conformal maps, fundamental forms, geodesics and geodesic equations, Christoffel symbols, and covariant derivatives. A very good book for these concepts is "Elementary Differential Geometry, 2nd Edition" by Andrew Pressley. You can easily find this book online. Additionally, Lia Vass's notes on Differential Geometry are excellent: [Lia Vass Notes]( https://liavas.net/courses/math430/ ).

3. Tensor Calculus 
Now it’s time to build intuition for the mathematics of General Relativity. After mastering the basics of tensors and differential geometry, the third and very important step is tensor calculus, including advanced tensors. Important concepts related to GR include metric tensors, parallel transport, intrinsic and extrinsic derivatives, Lie derivatives, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Riemann curvature tensor, and Einstein tensor. There is a very good YouTube playlist that explains these concepts and provides geometrical and physical interpretations: [YouTube Tensor Calculus Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXr1SF3WmA&list=PLJHszsWbB6hpk5h8lSfBkVrpjsqvUGTCx). A very good book on this subject is "Tensor Calculus for Physics" by Dwight.

Study the Theory:

Once you have studied the mathematics and built intuition, it’s time to start the theory. Begin with a very simple book suitable for self-study. Avoid grasping standard GR books initially, like "Gravitation," because they will be hard to understand. A very good start would be "Relativity Demystified" by David McMahon. You can skip the first four chapters since you already covered the mathematics and start from Chapter 5, moving on to Einstein’s field equations. Alongside this book, use "A First Course in General Relativity, 2nd Edition" by Bernard Schutz. It will help a lot if you also watch the MIT lecture series on General Relativity: [MIT GR Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRVfaR3N5K4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP629n_3fX7HmKKgin_rqGzbx).

Following this approach to studying General Relativity proved very effective for me. Once you reach this point, studying any other concept in the field of General Relativity will be much easier.
